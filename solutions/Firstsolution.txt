Solution Strategy

The solution involves creating a fair system that gives all guests a chance to drink water eventually. Here's my proposal:
Rotating Cup Placement System

Initial Round Setup:

Number all guests from 1 to N
For the first round, guests place cups in numerical order (Guest 1's cup first, Guest 2's cup second, etc.)
Host fills the first cup (Guest 1) and the last cup (Guest N)


For Subsequent Rounds:

Create a rotation system where:

The order shifts by 2 positions each round
Example: Round 1: [1,2,3,...,N], Round 2: [3,4,...,N,1,2], etc.


Implementation:

Each guest keeps track of their drinking turn
After each round, those who drank share a small portion with those who didn't
The rotation ensures everyone gets a turn to drink within ⌈N/2⌉ rounds


Enforcement Mechanism:

Any guest who deviates from the rotation is excluded from all future rounds
Since water is a vital resource, this creates a strong incentive to cooperate


Anti-Cheating Measures:

The host (you) marks the positions clearly to prevent confusion
All cup placements happen simultaneously to prevent last-second changes
Each round has a designated timekeeper among the guests
